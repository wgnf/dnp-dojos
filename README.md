# dotnetpro Dojos Solutions

[dotnetpro](https://www.dotnetpro.de/) is a german magazine for the .NET community. The author [Stefan Lieser](https://www.dotnetpro.de/autor/stefan-lieser-1083032.html) frequently releases little excercises (called dojo's) for developers to train their abilities.  
  
This repository is for me to personally keep track of the solutions that I came up with.
